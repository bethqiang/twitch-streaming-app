# Twitch Streaming App
A web app that allows you to view which Twitch streamers are online and if they are, what they're streaming.

Demo link: [https://bethqiang.github.io/twitch-streaming-app](https://bethqiang.github.io/twitch-streaming-app)

Built using HTML, CSS, [Flexboxes](http://flexbox.io/), [the Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/), JavaScript, JQuery, and [Twitch.tv's JSONP API](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API).

Current functionalities include:
* Filter streamers by online or offline status.
* If a user is streaming, view what they're streaming.
* Click a status output and be sent directly to the corresponding Twitch.tv channel.
* See a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).

Future ideas include:
* Search for any Twitch user.
* Add any Twitch user to your feed.
* Delete any Twitch user from your feed.
* Possibly embed/view embedded stream on the desktop version.
